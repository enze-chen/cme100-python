Let us know!
This is the first draft and we'd like to hear your feedback.

This Jupyter Book contains a series of Python exercises aimed at introducing you to scientific computing in the context of [CME 100: Vector Calculus for Engineers](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=cme100+vector) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).
The exercises are adapted from the MATLAB Workbook by [Vadim Khayms](https://icme.stanford.edu/people/vadim-khayms), Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering, and created by [Enze Chen](https://enze-chen.github.io/).
We hope students will find these exercises useful in their studies!


```{note}
If you're submitting work for credit, you only have to submit **one of** the MATLAB _or_ Python exercises.
You will not be rewarded for both, though you're welcome to do both for practice.
These pages only have Python, corresponding to the exercises in the original MATLAB Workbook.
```


## What do I install?

Nothing! Unlike the MATLAB exercises, we'll be doing everything in the cloud. 
If you like the sound of this, keep reading the [](workbook/0_usage.ipynb) for instructions on how to complete and submit your work.


## Does it _really_ not matter which language I learn?

Correct. 
In the context of the course, **homeworks and tutorials will still be given in MATLAB** as we experiment with the transition to Python (allowed for optional components), but the underlying computing principles and [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking) are the same.
Sure, certain tasks may be easier in one language than the other as they were developed by different scientific communities, but we anticipate that learning one will serve as a solid foundation so you can easily transition to another programming language in your future work.
