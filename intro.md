This Jupyter Book contains a series of Python exercises aimed at introducing you to scientific computing in the context of [CME 100: Vector Calculus for Engineers](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=cme100+vector) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/).
The exercises are adapted from the MATLAB Workbook by [Vadim Khayms](https://icme.stanford.edu/people/vadim-khayms), Senior Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering, and created to meet the demands of students, faculty, and industry.
We hope students will find these exercises useful in their studies!


```{note}
If you're submitting work for credit, you only have to submit **one of** the MATLAB _or_ Python exercises.
You will not be rewarded for both, though you're welcome to do both for practice.
These pages only have Python, corresponding to the exercises in the original MATLAB Workbook.
