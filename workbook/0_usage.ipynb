Python makes it easy for developers to write _modules_ that extend its functionalities for applications in [data science](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), [scientific computing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2), and [flying drones on Mars](https://twitter.com/ThePSF/status/1362516507918483458?s=20).\n",
